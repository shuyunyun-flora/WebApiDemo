        There are lots of different kinds of fruit - there are over 500 varieties of banana alone.
        By the time we add the countless types of apples, oranges, and other well-known fruit, we are faced with
        thousands of choices.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the most interesting aspects of fruit is the variety available in each country. <span>I live near London</span>, in an area
        which is known for its apples.

        When travelling in Asia, I was struck by how many different kinds of banana were available - many of which
        had unique flavours and which were only available within a small region.
